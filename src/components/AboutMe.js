        <h1 className="about-tittle"> My name is Andriy Konzelskiy </h1>
        <p> I was born and raised in the village of Verbovets. I'm studied at Verbovetska Secondary School of I-III grades. </p>
        <p>I've always been interested in how to write all sorts of programs and how the computer works in general. At school I went to extra classes in computer science. I was doing well and I tried my hand at the Olympics. I managed to take first place in my school and in district competitions. I had to go to regional competitions, but at that time I fell ill and could not go to show my skills there. </p>
        <p> To get to know computers further and in more detail, after graduating from school I entered Ternopil National Technical University named after Ivan Pulyuy. He studied there at the Department of Computer Science, majoring in Computer Science, and received a bachelor's degree. After that, I entered the master's program at the same department, but the specialty was already "Systems Analysis". </p>
        <p>I got a job in the 4th year of study at the Ternopil Regional Court of Appeal, which is now called the Ternopil Court of Appeal, and to this day I work there as the Chief Specialist of the Information Technology Sector.</p>
        <p> In my spare time, I enjoyed writing small programs in the AutoHotkey scripting language, and I was able to write a small program that could play sound through a microphone (like the Soundpad) for my voiceless friend so she could give minimal and fast information while playing. I'm also wrote a binder for GTA-RP and many other small projects. </p>
        <p>I made a bot for myself in Discord with minimal functionality. In my free time I worked as a freelancer. There I was filling sites, creating intro and autro for video. I'm also worked with Inova Diamonds on autsorce. Processed pictures for them in Photoshop. </p>
        <p>The last few years I became interested in creating sites and little by little taught HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS. My goal now is to create various PET programs on ReactJS to improve my skills and abilities so that I can get a job as a Frontend developer.</p>
